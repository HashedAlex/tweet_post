Crypto regulation in the US is inching toward clarity—finally. Senate Banking Committee lawmakers insist a crypto bill is "closer than ever," even after a key hearing was postponed.

This persistence signals a structural shift: policymakers are now actively working to craft legislation rather than dismissing crypto altogether. The delay isn't a failure; it’s a negotiation phase. Both sides—pro-crypto advocates and skeptics—are grappling with how to balance innovation with risk. Importantly, this isn’t just talk. The fact that lawmakers are pushing forward suggests they see political capital in getting something passed, likely before the 2024 election cycle heats up.

Our desk sees this as a bullish backdrop for institutional adoption. Regulatory clarity removes a major overhang for traditional players considering crypto exposure. While the specifics remain unknown, the mere progress toward a framework could unlock structural demand. We’re watching for drafts to assess the carve-outs and restrictions, but the direction is clear: crypto is being integrated into the financial system.

Stance: Bullish on institutional adoption catalysts

Washington gridlock loosens on crypto—but don’t pop champagne yet. Senate Banking Committee lawmakers claim progress on crypto legislation is “closer than ever,” even after a key hearing delay pushed timelines back.

This isn’t just political lip service. Lawmakers doubling down on optimism despite procedural setbacks signals prioritization of crypto regulation—a rare bipartisan target. Our desk sees this as a structural shift: crypto is no longer fringe but mainstream enough for politicians to lean into. The delay likely reflects logistical hurdles, not waning momentum, suggesting legislation is still a 2026 priority.

For markets, clarity on regulation remains the north star. A comprehensive framework could unlock institutional inflows while easing compliance burdens—both bullish for liquidity. But timing is critical; prolonged uncertainty could weigh on sentiment. Stance: Neutral until bill specifics emerge, but structurally constructive on adoption narrative.

Goldman Sachs is going all-in on crypto infrastructure. CEO David Solomon confirmed the firm is aggressively allocating resources to tokenization, stablecoins, and prediction markets—a clear institutional pivot.

This isn’t exploratory dabbling. When a Tier 1 bank publicly commits "significant resources," it signals structural adoption is accelerating. Our desk sees this as validation of the institutional liquidity thesis—Goldman’s move will force competitors to accelerate their own crypto roadmaps or risk losing market share. The focus on stablecoins and tokenization specifically suggests they’re positioning for the next wave of real-world asset (RWA) adoption, where traditional finance rails intersect with blockchain efficiency.

We view this as bullish for crypto’s infrastructure layer. Goldman’s imprimatur adds credibility to the institutional narrative, which should tighten spreads and improve liquidity in regulated crypto products. Expect other bulge brackets to follow suit, creating a structural bid for compliant protocols. Stance: Bullish on regulated crypto infrastructure.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs just roared back with their largest inflow week in 4 months—institutional demand is alive and well.

$1.42 billion poured into spot Bitcoin ETFs last week, marking the strongest week since October. Notably, this surge coincided with reduced whale selling pressure, suggesting a clear shift in market dynamics. Our desk sees this as more than just a short-term flow—it’s a validation of structural demand for regulated crypto exposure. ETF inflows are particularly sticky, as they represent institutional allocations rather than speculative trading. 

The key takeaway here is liquidity. ETF flows have become a primary driver of Bitcoin’s price action, creating a self-reinforcing cycle where inflows support prices, which in turn attract more inflows. Reduced whale selling adds to this narrative, as it indicates less overhead supply hitting the market. Most importantly, this flow surge signals that institutions are once again comfortable deploying capital into crypto—a bullish signal for the asset class as a whole. 

We see this as a confirmation of Bitcoin’s growing role as an institutional asset and a positive repricing catalyst for the broader market.

South Korea may finally break the crypto exchange banking oligopoly. Regulators are reviewing the "one bank per exchange" rule that has bottlenecked market access and liquidity for years.  

This matters because the current system created artificial gatekeeping—only a handful of banks were willing to partner with exchanges, leading to concentration risk and limited competition. If scrapped, we could see a surge in exchange liquidity as new banking relationships form, reducing settlement friction and potentially lowering trading costs. The market is underestimating how much this could improve capital flows, especially for altcoins that suffered from limited KRW pairing access.  

Our desk sees this as a structural positive for Korean crypto markets, with second-order benefits for global liquidity if arbitrage channels open wider. The key risk is implementation timeline—regulatory reviews often move slower than traders hope.
