TOPIC: BLACK WEEKEND - THE "GREAT RESET" OF GLOBAL LIQUIDITY
STATUS: URGENT / BEARISH

KEY DATA:
- Bitcoin is on the verge of breaking the psychological $70,000 support.
- Gold and Silver are plunging simultaneously, signaling a "Liquidity Event" (Dash for Cash), not just a standard Risk-Off correction.

CORE NARRATIVE (The "Great Reset"):
1. **Macro Expectations Reset:** The market is violently repricing from a "Soft Landing" to a "Liquidity Crunch". The synchronized drop in Store of Value assets (Gold + BTC) indicates that investors are selling everything to raise USD cash.
2. **Liquidity Withdrawal:** The lag effect of the Fed's "Higher for Longer" is finally hitting. M2 supply contraction is overpowering the ETF inflows.
3. **The Trap:** The recent rally to $70k was driven by leverage and "Fed Pivot" hopes. Now that rate cut expectations are fading (or delayed by Trade War inflation fears), that leverage is being flushed out.
4. **Conclusion:** This is a healthy but painful "Great Reset" of expectations. Until $58k-$60k support is tested or Fed liquidity returns, caution is king.
