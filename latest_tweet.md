South Korea may finally break the crypto exchange banking oligopoly. Regulators are reviewing the "one bank per exchange" rule that has bottlenecked market access and liquidity for years.  

This matters because the current system created artificial gatekeeping—only a handful of banks were willing to partner with exchanges, leading to concentration risk and limited competition. If scrapped, we could see a surge in exchange liquidity as new banking relationships form, reducing settlement friction and potentially lowering trading costs. The market is underestimating how much this could improve capital flows, especially for altcoins that suffered from limited KRW pairing access.  

Our desk sees this as a structural positive for Korean crypto markets, with second-order benefits for global liquidity if arbitrage channels open wider. The key risk is implementation timeline—regulatory reviews often move slower than traders hope.
