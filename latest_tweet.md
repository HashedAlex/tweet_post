Spot Bitcoin ETFs just roared back with their largest inflow week in 4 months—institutional demand is alive and well.

$1.42 billion poured into spot Bitcoin ETFs last week, marking the strongest week since October. Notably, this surge coincided with reduced whale selling pressure, suggesting a clear shift in market dynamics. Our desk sees this as more than just a short-term flow—it’s a validation of structural demand for regulated crypto exposure. ETF inflows are particularly sticky, as they represent institutional allocations rather than speculative trading. 

The key takeaway here is liquidity. ETF flows have become a primary driver of Bitcoin’s price action, creating a self-reinforcing cycle where inflows support prices, which in turn attract more inflows. Reduced whale selling adds to this narrative, as it indicates less overhead supply hitting the market. Most importantly, this flow surge signals that institutions are once again comfortable deploying capital into crypto—a bullish signal for the asset class as a whole. 

We see this as a confirmation of Bitcoin’s growing role as an institutional asset and a positive repricing catalyst for the broader market.
